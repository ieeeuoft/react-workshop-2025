## 4. Repo structure
The repository has four branches - `master`, `counter`, and `solution`. Each branch corresponds to a milestone for the workshop


#### The `master` branch
The `master` branch is a template for participants to follow during the workshop. It contains a home page and a broken version of the counter that we were building on top of during the workshop. If you run `npm run dev`, you should see the following pages, and you should be able to navigate around the home page and the counter

* The home page

* The broken counter

To navigate to the `master` branch, run `git checkout master`


### The `counter` branch
The `counter` branch contains the counter App. If you run `npm run dev`, you should see the home page and be able to navigate to the counter. You can play around with the counter!

To navigate to the `counter` branch, run `git checkout counter`


### The `solution` branch
The `solution` branch primarily serves as a solution reference to the workshop. It contains the code of everything we built during the workshop. 

To use the solution code
1. Copy your own API access key from https://manage.exchangeratesapi.io/dashboard
2. Inside your working directory (`React_workshop`), create a file called `.env.local`
3. Inside the file, add the following line `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY = your API access key`. Replace `your API access key` with your own API access key

Now, if you run `npm run dev`, you should see the following page and be able to navigate around the counter, exchange rate App, and the home page.

To navigate to the `solution` branch, run `git solution exchange`
